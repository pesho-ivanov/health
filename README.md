MRI
---

The brain MRI is taken as I was a volunteer for a research about the quantities of water and fat in/around the brain. (TODO: add a link to the results)

I asked the same scientists to make a scan of my knees too as I didn't know why they hurt. A [Hoffa's syndrome](http://orthopaedic.com.sg/hoffas-syndrome-fat-pad-impingement-syndrome-a-cause-of-anterior-knee-pain/) was diagnosed as a result.
