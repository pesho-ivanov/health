My personal health &amp; medical data

Genetics
--------

My genetical data (SNPs) is taken by [23andme](https://www.23andme.com/) in 2012. It is also shared at [OpenSNP](https://opensnp.org/users/637).

Browse my Promethease HTML report: [using HTMLpreview.github.io](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petar-ivanov/health/blob/master/genetics/promethease-report-Petar-Ivanov/report.html).

MRI
---

The brain MRI is taken as I was a volunteer for a research about the quantities of water and fat in/around the brain. (TODO: add a link to the results)

I asked the same scientists to make a scan of my knees too as I didn't know why they hurt. A [Hoffa's syndrome](http://orthopaedic.com.sg/hoffas-syndrome-fat-pad-impingement-syndrome-a-cause-of-anterior-knee-pain/) was diagnosed as a result.
